##PDFDownloader
PDF Downloader is a Chromium-powered browser extension that allows you to download read-only files. To download the book, you need an Internet connection and a website where this file will be hosted (i.e. you can read the entire file right now or scroll through it to the very end). Then follow the intuitive instructions of the extension.
